        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          HI! I'm Susie. I'm 27 years old and I live in Liverpool. I work in an
          escape room in the city centre. Some of my interests include playing
          the bass guitar, watching The Simpsons (literally every day), playing
          badminton, and more recently...learning to code!
        </p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I have a First Class degree in Music from the University of Liverpool.
          My dissertation focused on the use of both originally composed and
          pre-existing music in films, and their effects on viewer/listener
          perception. I also discussed negative aspects of music listening (who
          knew there were any?!) such as music as a weapon!
        </p>

        <h2>Jobs History</h2>
        <p>
          Prior to managing the escape room I co-ran a vintage/record shop with
          my friend in Liverpool City Centre. Before this, I worked at a concert
          hall for eight years.
